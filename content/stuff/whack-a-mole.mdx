This video is the result of a discussion with someone learning front-end development about the absurdity of some coding challenges during hiring processes. I suggested that, if I was the interviewer, I would ask  the applicant to make a dead simple "[Whack-A-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole)" game in [Vanillaâ„¢ JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/).

I made that screen cast to validate the idea (because I wouldn't challenge someone with something I wouldn't do myself).

The code itself isn't perfect and I'm well aware of that (might be better structured, they are some tiny leftovers, and so on).
