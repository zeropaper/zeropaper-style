This project is a tool I created for myself to ease the creation CSS polygons for another of my projects.

This is the kind of project I like the most because it is really tiny and scoped in its goal and yet
can greatly improve my workflow or turn in a fairly complex and interesting user experience excercise.

I am not sure if I will ever need to create a polygon again, but it was enriching for me
and potentially useful for others.
