    I began creating with softwares like 3D Studio Max and Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Flash and the likes. Although I was still studying, it's around that time that I wrote my first invoices and started working on my first website and took the 'zeropaper' alias.

    Moved to Berlin and worked for several years as a freelance web developer. Mostly with PHP at first, focusing on Drupal after a while. Mundraub.org, reset.org and Nitro Snowboards are among my favorite projects of that time. Although the period started on the back-end side, I gradually moved to the front-end side and started working with Sass (Compass), 96 grids and of course jQuery. And that I switched from SVN to GIT.

    I got convinced to take a position at a VTC start-up funded by Sixt but the experience cut short as they moved the whole development to an other location (and remote work wasn't a thing back in the days). However, it's during that time that I started using front-end frameworks like Backbone.js. It's about that time that I first used a JavaScript bundler like Grunt.js and wrote my first plugins for it.
