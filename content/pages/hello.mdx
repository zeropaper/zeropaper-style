# Hello
<!-- 
**Disclaimer:** This page is a work in progress.

My name is Valentin and I am born in the french part of Switzerland in the beginning of the 80's.

As I finished mandatory school I spend 4 years learning technical drawing in order to become an architect.   
The profession was evolving and the first, fairly accessible, CAD softwares came on the market during that time. And while I learned a lot about planing, coordination, systems and construction, I also discovered computer graphics and created my first online portfolio of 3D works during these years.

It is during my multimedia concept design studies I started in 2001 that my interest for interaction and visual creation has developed.  
Berlin seemed like a natural choice to immerge in a creative and technology enthusiastic environment after I graduated from [EIKON](http://eikon.ch/).

After more than 7 years of freelancing experience mostly building websites, portals and an [SMS based surveying tool for scientific researches](https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/44/4/423/248886), the Berlin based company [Camunda](https://camunda.com) convinced me to join their team of amazing developers.  
My work in this company has been varied, from setting up complex build system to the elaboration of a consistant design for the webapps, software development kit, components library and websites of the company as well as end-to-end testing.  
And best of all, most of the work I did at Camunda was published open-source.

The surge to learn new technics and stay professionally fit led me to leave Camunda after 3 years. Within a few month, I learned some of the newly added DOM features by creating an open-source, realtime audio analysis capable live-coding VJing software called [Visual Fiha](https://visual-fiha.gitlab.io/) that runs in the browser and can be controlled by MIDI devices.

In 2017, an offer for a position of lecturer at [Devugees](http://devugees.org) picked my curiosity and I gave it a try. But realized that I actually prefer to learn, create and mentor when asked.

I began to work with the jobpal team in Novemeber 2018 and spend 2 years developing the interface which allowed to train and manage their chatbots, improving and maintaining most parts of the business back-end.

Two years precisely after I joined the jobpal team, the company got acquired by [SmartRecruiters](https://smartrecruiters.com) and I am now working on integrating the jobpal chatbot training user interface into SmartRecruiters. 

## Tech

In the early 2000's most of my code was **HTML** and **Flash**. As **XHTML** came out I embraced the seperation of concerns and dived deep in **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

It felt natural to start learning *functional programming* with **PHP**, **MySQL** and I gained some experience with **XML**, **RelaxNG** and **XSLT** as the first trainee [Liip (formerly Mediagonal)](https://liip.ch) ever had.  
It's also during that period that switched from **Window** to **Debian** (and later **Kubuntu** which is still my favorite operating system).

It is when I arrived in Berlin in 2005 that I learned to use **Subversion** (SVN), started creating websites, custom themes and modules for [**Drupal**](https://drupal.org) and involving myself in its developer community.  
In order to collaborate with other freelancers, I created an online development environment with [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) (which didn't belong to AWS at the time) on a personal server.
During many years my front-end stack was mostly based on **SASS** and **Compass**, **jQuery**, **UnderscoreJS** and **BackboneJS**.

At Camunda I first had to create the tools to compile the CSS and JavaScript assets, learn **AngularJS** (that I really don't like). On my free time and to balance the frustration, I built most of my personal projects (including the very first version of my VJing software) with the underrated **AmpersandJS** which was a sort of evolution of **BackboneJS**. I used it to do isomorphic code when **NodeJS** was still in its 0.10.x versions.  
The UI library CSS that I built for the Camunda apps was based on **Bootstrap** and **Less**, compiled with **RequireJS** and heavily tested with **Protractor**.
It also became clear to me that **Swagger** (now **OpenAPI**) is provinding a fantasic opportunity to ease the server / client exchanges in a **RESTfull** fashion and spent countless days on personal projects involving **ExpressJS**, **PassportJS**, **Sequelize** or **Mongoose** and **Socket.io**.

During my short time as lecturer, I used **NeutrinoJS** to reduce the struggle of my students at configuring **Webpack**.

I worked in a tiny designer company during 6 months and created an application for the Berlin ice hockey team fans with **React Native**.

It's at jobpal that I could use my **ReactJS** and **Redux** knowledge and discovered the **Material UI** library on which the B2B application on.  
It was a pleasant surprise to use **JSS** because my VJing software was already using the **CSS** object model to generate visuals.  
I chose **Jest** and **testing-library** to write the tests of the front-end and I had to continue writing back-end tests with **Mocha**.  
On my free time I made several attempts to convince my colleagues to use **OpenAPI** for more than documentation, reorganize the B2B application by moving the presentational components to a seperate repository and use **Puppeteer** to add some E2E testing and generate documentation automatically.  
It was never done but I learned some new things.  
It's also during these years that I discovered **Gatsby** (that is used to build this website) and some **GraphQL** (still want to learn more about it).

Nowadays, I'm slowly but surely switching to **TypeScript** because the market asks for it. I'm also poking around **Go** and **Rust** in order to compile to **WebAssembly** and thus improve even more the performance of my VJing application.

## Work

soft skills, pragmatism, planing, product design, habits, clean code, nice documentation, Scrum, Kanban, process, single source of truth, ...

**TBC**

## Dream job

The best work environment I can think of would be a small, remote, team in which I would be asked for my opinion, technical expertise, my eye for design, my interest for developer experience and capabilities in mentoring.

I especially enjoyed creating libraries at Camunda because it was released under open-source license and the target audience was fellow developers. Therefore I knew precisely what I would have liked if using these libraries and I actually did.

**TBC**

Tech advocate? Start-up co-founder?

At least not at the end of the food chain.

## Hiring me?

enough code available on GH, happy to comment / present some of it
