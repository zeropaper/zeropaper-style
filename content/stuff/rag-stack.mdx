That tiny project is a stripped down version of something bigger I am actually working on that
focuses on the retrieval of data and generation of texts based on that data
(a.k.a. [R.A.G.](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/ "for the hipsters
and search engines")).

Sure enough, it is just a bunch of tutorials put together and it would be a crime to actually
use that as a base to build on top.
