My name is Valentin.  
I was born in the French speaking part of Switzerland in the early
80's but I lived in Berlin nearly half my life.  
I speak fluently French, English and German.  
Professionally, I consider myself a digital craftsman and
personnally, a creative coder.

I am currently exploring the potential paths my career could take
and updating my skills.  
If you believe I can add value to your product and your
company, [please get in touch on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vvago).
